# GitHub Actions workflow for generating and uploading SBOM to Dependency-Track
# This workflow uses CycloneDX format to generate a BOM from Python dependencies
# and automatically uploads it to Dependency-Track for vulnerability scanning.
#
# Required repository secrets (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret):
#   - DTRACK_API_KEY      : API key for Dependency-Track authentication
#   - DTRACK_PROJECT_UUID : Unique identifier for the project in Dependency-Track
#
# Workflow behavior:
# - Triggers on push to main or broken branches, or manual dispatch
# - Uses ubuntu-latest runner
# - Checks out full git history (fetch-depth: 0)
# - Generates CycloneDX XML BOM from requirements.txt
# - Uploads BOM to Dependency-Track API for vulnerability analysis
# - Saves BOM as workflow artifact for download/debugging
